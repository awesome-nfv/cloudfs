Requirements
----
1. Linux >2.6

2. libfuse


How it works
----
Cloudfs creates an object filesystem on top of popular cloud
storage services.  This filesystem can only be accessed with
cloudfs only.  It also supports transparent encryption and zlib 
compression. 


Compiling
----
1. Run ./config.sh && make

2. Copy bin/cloudfs to /usr/sbin/

3. Copy bin/cloudfs.conf to ~/.cloudfs.conf

4. Edit ~/.cloudfs.conf


Command-line options
----
Listing volumes:
	cloudfs --list
	
Create a new volume:
	cloudfs --volume [volume] --create
	
Mounting the volume:
	cloudfs --volume [volume] --mount [directory]
	
Unmounting the volume:
	cloudfs --volume [volume] --unmount [directory]
		or
	umount [directory]
	
Deleting the volume:
	cloudfs --volume [volume] --delete


Tips and tricks
----
If you're going to use rsync with cloudfs, you'll see an improvement in
performance if you specify the " --inplace " flag with rsync. This
flag is not required, but highly recommended.

For automated scripts, you can add the " --force " flag to prevent
prompting.

You can't mount the same bucket twice at the same time for writing,
but you can use the " --readonly " flag to mount a bucket in read-only
mode.
